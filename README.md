# React + TypeScript + Vite<br>Library example

This template provides a minimal setup to get a React component library working in Vite with HMR and ESLint.

It contains a Counter component. If you're looking to use the Counter component as a base for something else, the component name is defined and used in the following files:

- package.json
- vite.config.js
- App.tsx
- src/Counter.tsx
- src/index.ts
